From then on, you can run it normally using the green arrow button

- Once it's running, there will be scanner prompts in the console that are pretty self explanatory. 
- You start by choosing a white piece to move based on the coordinates. 
- You then are presented a list of viable moves.
- Choose a tile from those moves to move the piece.
- The console then displays all the current pieces held by both teams, as well as the current removed pieces.
- It then changes teams.
- It asks you to type 'Y' to continue, but you can actually input anything other than 'end.'
- From there it changes teams and repeats.
